### Problem statement:

# Back in the stone age (before CSS), we used spaces to align 
# things on the screen. If we have a 40-character wide table 
# of Flintstone family members, how can we center the following 
# title above the table with spaces?

title = "Flintstone Family Members"

### Solution:

print(title.center(40))
